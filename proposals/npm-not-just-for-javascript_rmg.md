## Abstract

NPM was built for Node, and by extension, JavaScript. I've been experimenting
with using npm as a means for cross-platform, cross-language packaging. This
talk follows my adventures in seeing just how far NPM can be stretched in the
name of polyglot package management.

I'm leading the DevOps charge at StrongLoop where I'm automating all the things
and helping developers push to production. Some call it tools, some call it
DevOps, and some call it full-stack. I call it "building stuff for others like
me".
