# True Random Data with Node.js and Arduino

Ever wonder about what exactly is the difference between "pesudo-random" data and so-called "true" random data? Well in this talk I will step you through the difference and how it is measured. To demostrate the difference more clearly we will play around with an Arduino that generates random data for us, and go over how it works. It is a fun mash-up of software, hardware, and how important randomness can be.
