### Talk summary

Sooner or later, we all have, or will have to join a “completed” project only to find jQuery soup: functions within functions nested inside AJAX callbacks. It sucks. How did our beloved web language bring us here? 

In this session, we'll be going over how to level-up your JS and transition from leveraging jQuery plugins to writing full-blown Javascript applications. We'll cover the basics of everything from avoiding callback hell, to writing sustainable applications with a modern workflow, to best practices and the future of Javascript with ES6.
