## Abstract

The last several years have been an exciting time to work with JavaScript. Run-times, tooling, frameworks, libraries and even alternate languages have all advanced immensely: compilers, debuggers, linkers and loaders, we've got 'em all now.

As web developers, we are now all in a position to write modular, composable, re-useable and tested code.

In this talk I will discuss:

- your various choices for module systems, and why what matters most is that you just pick one and go with it
- the fundamentals of writing testable modules (careful with your closures)
- incredibly useful testing tools for faking, mocking and otherwise impersonating your dependencies and client code, asynchronous or otherwise
- finally, and most usefully, how to refactor old jquery spaghetti into small, testable modules

Noah makes very much unintended use of the DOM and crafts suspiciously long URLs as an engineer on Mobify's product team. He used to do distributed computing at Apple, and in his spare time he likes to spend far too long scanning photographic negatives.
