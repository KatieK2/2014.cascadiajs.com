## Abstract

There has been an explosion of new JavaScript development tools in the past few years to help us build better JavaScript apps and libraries. This is great for the seasoned JavaScript developer as they can pick and choose and find what best suits them. However, this is a cause of a lot of confusion for the newcomer, they often get lost trying to pick the right build tools, testing frameworks, development environments etc.

In this talk I'll map out the lay of the land in JavaScript development tools and then recommend a minimal yet powerful workflow that worked best for me. This talk is for both beginners and advanced JavaScript developers.
