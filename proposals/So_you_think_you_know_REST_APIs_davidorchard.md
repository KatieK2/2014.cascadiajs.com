##Abstract

You've built REST APIs fo a while now, and think you are the ... stuff.
But there's an awful lot of previous history that might help you.  Or not.
This talk will go into some of the deeper aspects of API design.  Things
that go bump in the night like description languages, request boxcarring, 
transacation semantics, partial updates, collision detection, and versioning.
