## Abstract

When I somewhat inexplicably decided to start a NodeSchool event in Baltimore, I had no especially relevant experience at all and no reason to believe it wouldn't end in a total disaster. So far, that thankfully hasn't stopped swarms of volunteers and learners of all skill levels from showing up and having a great time learning Node together.

As it turns out, defining this kind of "community" is hard and building a good one is even harder! While I'm certainly no expert, I've learned a lot along the way and I'm dying to share with you a little about what NodeSchool is, what's unique about it, and why I think getting involved in building this kind of community should be more important to us than commas, semicolons or tabs.
_Note: the title is a trick question._
