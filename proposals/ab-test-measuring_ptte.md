## Abstract

A/B testing is a great way of knowing if the changes you just made to your code and design are actually better. Pair that with good metrics and you will know what drives your users.

But how do you implement A/B testing on all layers in your services, low level code, and up to the templates?

Having been through several iterations of A/B systems at Bloglovin, I'll walk through how setting up your own A/B testing as a service isn't that hard. Using some node and a few simple http requests, you can get complete control of what you're testing, who sees your changes and for how long.
