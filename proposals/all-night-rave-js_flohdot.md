## Abstract

Sometimes a software developer finds herself surrounded by people who throw crazy parties. What skills does she have that can be used to maximize fun and profit? Writing code, of course! 

In this talk, I will teach you how to whip up web services to gather data from partygoers, provide your friends with their own controllers, and render data into beautiful live visuals with Processing. It will demonstrate how to use node.js and socket.io to connect people through pretty things, create a sense of community in a small space, and make your friends go "whoaa, dude!"

We will also briefly explore some of the hilarious hardships spoiled software developers face when having to code for the physical world (spoiler alert: duct tape everywhere!).
