##Abstract

Once upon a time Postgres built a reputation for being an unfriendly database.
And it's still paying for some of that reputation today, but the last few
releases have added several impressive features especially for node developers.

JSON and hstore allow you to have your cake and eat it too when it comes to
relational and schemaless storage. PLV8 lets you run javascript right in the
database using the same V8 engine as Chrome and Node. We'll cover in which
cases it makes sense to use Postgres and which it doesn't.

You don't need any prior SQL experience for this talk, and you'll walk away
with all you need to know to take advantage of these powerful features.
