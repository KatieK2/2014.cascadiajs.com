##Abstract

> "The browser is not an HTML renderer, it's the world's most ubiquitous, yet capable, runtime." â€” [@HenrikJoreteg](https://blog.andyet.com/2014/01/17/web-has-outgrown-the-browser)

JavaScript and the browser are so powerful, the possibilities of what you can build are limitless. *But there is a fundamental difference when you treat the browser as a runtime instead of a document renderer.*

When I first started building "apps" they were a mess of unstructured HTML with JavaScript laid on top. Even using MVC or event frameworks did more harm than good, as it was just another messy layer of JavaScript.

**So how can you build clean, structured, fully clientside rendered, 100% JavaScript *apps*?**

The secret lies in leveraging Browserify and npm, while also creating small composable clientside models and views. This allows for a sane and simple development environment, without sacrificing anything in the quality of your app. 

Striking a balance between simple and powerful, learn how to use these concepts to take away the frustration of unmaintainable clientside code & complex development environments, and replace them with the relaxation one should feel when they spend the day at the SPA.
