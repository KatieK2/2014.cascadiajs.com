## Abstract

Sure, everybody knows that you start working on a new Node module by running
`npm init`, but did you know about using `npm dedupe` to simplify your
`node_modules` folder? How about using `npm shrinkwrap` to version-lock all
your dependencies? Everybody's npm workflow is different (people use npm for so
many different things!), but there are a core set of functions -- not all of
them well-known -- that make working with Node modules simpler and easier.

npm is your gateway to Moduletopia! Spending some time to learn how to use it
more effectively will save you far more time down the road!
