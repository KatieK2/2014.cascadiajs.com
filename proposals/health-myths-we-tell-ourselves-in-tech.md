##Abstract

The 10x programmer is a unicorn. We love to lionize the amount of dedication, time, and thought that goes into creating great software -- but we forget the very real cost it can entail, both emotionally and physically, on the programmer. Depression, RSI, burnout: these are all real issues facing our field.

I have many friends who have dealt with these, and I've dealt with RSI myself. I'd like to share my experience and all the mistakes I have made while dealing with them.

I do not come with quick fixes or a bullet list. Preventative measures only go so far. One does not simply walk into good health. It is a methodical process.

One can, though, be aware of what to think and worry about, and how to deal and go forward if one is dealing with health problems. I promise you knowledge, laughs, and the ability to help anyone going through these issues, be it a friend or yourself.

And above all...

A TREANDMILL DESK WILL NOT SAVE YOU!

Matthew is a polyglot programmer who feels there is something to learn from every language... even basic. He is a photo documenter for the js community and continually strives to give back and make things both for "the thought leaders" and people just starting out.
