## Abstract

The Web offers a powerful platform for building real-time social apps that work across multiple devices. In this session, Iâ€™ll show you how to build a real-time Web app the fast and easy way with high-level frameworks that let you focus on application logic instead of network programming. You will learn how to use the powerful MontageJS HTML5 framework to build single-page applications that integrate with JavaScript backend stacks like SailsJS and Deployd, which are highly conducive to rapid prototyping.
