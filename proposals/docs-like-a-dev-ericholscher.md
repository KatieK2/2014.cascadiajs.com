##Abstract

Writing documentation feels like a totally different world than writing code.
This talk will introduce developers to writing documentation in more familiar way.
We will talk about writing docs,
and view it through the lens of writing code.

We'll start with review of why documentation is important.
I find that any presentation to developers should include this section,
so that you care about the content that follows.

Then we'll cover the following concepts, applied to docs:

* Refactoring
* Extensibility
* Semantic Meaning (Semantic HTML)
* Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Reproducibility

After this talk,
writing documentation should feel like less of a chore.
You can start attacking your docs with similar tools and mindset as writing code.

This talk won't cover the mechanics of writing,
but more about how to think about documentation.
