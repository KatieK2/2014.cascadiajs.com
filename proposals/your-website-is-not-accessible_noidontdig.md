## Abstract

How do the elderly, the partially blind, the blind, the deaf, and the disabled use the web? How is your website unaccessible to them? And why should you care?

This talk looks at how people with disabilities use the web, and at the many CSS/HTML/JavaScript/Design principles that will enable you to make your app/website truly accessible.
