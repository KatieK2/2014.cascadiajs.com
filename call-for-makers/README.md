We are inviting the JavaScript community to submit projects to the JavaScript
Art Exhibit for CascadiaJS 2014 in Portland, OR. This Call for Makers will
close on July 1st. When you’re ready to submit a proposal, follow the
instructions below.

### What in the world are we looking for?
Have you SEEN what JavaScript can do lately??? We want you to make art that's
implemented using JavaScript! That could mean blinking lights. It could be an
immersive sound and light show. It could be an interaction with our attendees
that makes them contemplate the meaning of the number 42. The exhibit will kick
off the evening of July 30 as all of our attendees arrive and register, then
entering the opening party and show. Works will be on display through the main 
event space, halls, registration, and hacker zone. 

Ideally, the submissions are stand-alone projects that require no equipment or 
displays provided by the conference. At this point we can only commit to providing
a projector for in-browser works to be displayed. If we notice a pattern in 
submissions, such as hoping for sound collection or a web socket being useful, 
we could allocate resources towards it. We hope for projects that are interactive 
for attendees and evolving as the weekend progresses. Projects would be setup and 
taken down by their makers unless circumstances have been coordinated and agreed to 
prior by the conference.

We'll greenlight projects as soon as the deadline hits July 1st, as we
recognize how short this timeline will be. All makers will have a check-in one
week prior to make sure they can execute in time, and see if there's a need for
last-minute volunteer help to make magic happen.

### With a little help from our friends
Submissions that are greenlit will be able to submit receipts for reimbursement
up to $100 for materials. Please contact the organizing team if you have an
idea that would be outside of the scope of this budget but think it's worth
arguing for!

Please note that all reimbursements will be via PayPal.

*Please follow the instructions below and help us spread the word!*
### HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL
First, make sure you're available. Opening night is July 30th, and the
conference fun doesn't end until Aug. 2 at brunch.
* Create a [GitHub account](github.com) if you don't have one already
* Go to the [Call for Makers](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2014.cascadiajs.com/issues/new) new issue
* File a 'New Issue' using the 'What should be in the proposal?' below!

Wait patiently (and nicely) for us to get back to you, most likely very close
to July 1st. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's
just to say "You're awesome, but not this year".

### What should be in the proposal?
*Please enter the Title as "Title of Project" by First Name Last Name.*

If your submission is called "JS Explosions" and your GitHub ID/name is 
`janedoe` and `johndoe`, the title would be "JS Explosions" by Jane Doe and John Doe.

In the body of every proposal there should be, at minimum, the following information:
- Full names of submitters
- Email for submitter seeking reimbursement for project costs via PayPal
- Project title
- Project concept and description
- Any images you can share that help to convey your idea
- How you plan to implement the project in < 4 weeks

### MISC
We have a wonderful [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2014.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
It absolutely applies to these projects! Check it out! And of course, "Don't be
a jerk."

If you have any questions about this process or need more information, please
don't hesitate to reach out to us at
[info@cascadiajs.com](info@cascadiajs.com).
Thanks, The CascadiaJS Team


This insane effort absolutely would not be happening without the help of our
gracious sponsors, [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) and [Orchestrate.io](http://orchestrate.io).

#### And a super rad special offer from Orchestrate!
"CascadiaJS Makers!

Orchestrate is a proud sponsor of the interactive art contest at CascadiaJS this year, and is giving all makers a special offer for their art installations - use Orchestrate as your interactive installation's database backend for the contest (for free), and be eligible for a full year of free Orchestrate service!	

Why should you try Orchestrate? Orchestrate is a managed database service that’s ideal for building interactive apps for the Web, IoT, devices, and mobile. Its simple, RESTful API service eliminates the need to operate databases in production, which dramatically increases development time and allows developers to build complete apps, or add features to existing apps, in minutes. Powered by best-of-breed NoSQL databases, it unifies full-text search, social graph, key/value document and time-ordered event queries in a single interface. Orchestrate handles the complex task of building, operating, and scaling a high performance, fault tolerant data layer, so you don’t have to. 

Already have your data in another database? Don’t fret - you can easily use its [CouchDB](http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/06/18/replicating-couchdb-to-orchestrate/) connector, [JDBC importer](https://github.com/orchestrate-io/jdbc-importer) or [MongoDB exporter](http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/03/18/mongodb-to-orchestrate-in-a-few-simple-steps/). Take a look at Orchestrate’s [documentation](http://orchestrate.io/docs/) for getting started tutorials, sample apps, client libraries and more. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions [adam@orchestrate.io](adam@orchestrate.io)

We can’t wait to see what you create!"
