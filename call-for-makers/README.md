## CALL FOR MAKERS – THE DETAILS

We are inviting the JavaScript community to submit projects to the JavaScript
Art Exhibit for CascadiaJS 2014 in Portland, OR. This Call for Makers will
close on July 1st. When you’re ready to submit a proposal, follow the
instructions below.

### What in the world are we looking for?
Have you SEEN what JavaScript can do lately??? We want you to make art that's
implemented using JavaScript! That could mean blinking lights. It could be an
immersive sound and light show. It could be an interaction with our attendees
that makes them contemplate the meaning of the number 42. The exhibit will kick
off the evening of July 30 as all of our attendees arrive and register, then
entering the opening party and show. Works will be on display through the main event
space, halls, registration, and hacker zone. Ideally, the submissions are
stand-alone projects that require no equipment or displays provided by the
conference. At this point we can only commit to providing a projector for
in-browser works to be displayed. If we notice a pattern in submissions, such
as hoping for sound collection or a web socket being useful, we could allocate
resources towards it. We hope for projects that are interactive for attendees
and evolving as the weekend progresses. Projects would be setup and taken down
by their makers unless circumstances have been coordinated and agreed to prior
by the conference.

We'll greenlight projects as soon as the deadline hits July 1st, as we
recognize how short this timeline will be. All makers will have a check-in one
week prior to make sure they can execute in time, and see if there's a need for
last-minute volunteer help to make magic happen.

### With a little help from our friends
Submissions that are greenlit will be able to submit receipts for reimbursement
up to $100 for materials. Please contact the organizing team if you have an
idea that would be outside of the scope of this budget but think it's worth
arguing for!

Please note that all reimbursements will be via PayPal.

*Please follow the instructions below and help us spread the word!*
### HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL
First, make sure you're available. Opening night is July 30th, and the
conference fun doesn't end until Aug. 2 at brunch.
* Create a [GitHub account](github.com) if you don't have one already
* Fork this repository
* Checkout the `master` branch
* Create and commit a markdown (`.md`) file in this directory named after the project title and your GitHub ID.

For example, if your submission is called "JS Explosions" and your GitHub ID is `janedoe`, name the file `js-explosions_janedoe.md`. 

* When you're ready, submit a pull request.
* Wait patiently (and nicely) for us to get back to you, most likely very close
to July 1st. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's
just to say "You're awesome, but not this year".

### What should be in the proposal?
- Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information:
- Full names of submitters
- Email for submitter seeking reimbursement for project costs
- Project title
- Project concept and description
- Any images you can share that help to convey your idea
- How you plan to implement the project in < 4 weeks
